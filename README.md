# CompSci 235 S2 2024: Sample COVID-19 Web Application

## Description

A web-based digital podcast library (similar to Podchaser or ListenNotes), a platform where users can browse, search, and interact with a collection of podcasts. Users can also like podcasts, create playlists, and provide comments or ratings once logged in. The application uses Flask Blueprints to maintain a separation of concerns between application functions. Testing includes unit and end-to-end testing using the pytest tool. 

## Installation

**Installation via requirements.txt**

**Windows**
```shell
$ cd CS235-S2-2024-CovidWebApp
$ py -3 -m venv venv
$ venv\Scripts\activate
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**MacOS**
```shell
$ cd CS235-S2-2024-CovidWebApp
$ python3 -m venv venv
$ source venv/bin/activate
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

When using PyCharm, set the virtual environment using 'File'->'Settings' and select 'Project:CS235-S2-2024-CovidWebApp' from the left menu. Select 'Project Interpreter', click on the gearwheel button and select 'Add'. Click the 'Existing environment' radio button to select the virtual environment. 

## Execution

**Running the application**

From the *CS235-S2-2024-CovidWebApp* directory, and within the activated virtual environment (see *venv\Scripts\activate* above):

````shell
$ flask run
```` 


## Configuration

The *CS235-S2-2024-CovidWebApp/.env* file contains variable settings. They are set with appropriate values.

* `FLASK_APP`: Entry point of the application (should always be `wsgi.py`).
* `FLASK_ENV`: The environment in which to run the application (either `development` or `production`).
* `SECRET_KEY`: Secret key used to encrypt session data.
* `TESTING`: Set to False for running the application. Overridden and set to True automatically when testing the application.
* `WTF_CSRF_SECRET_KEY`: Secret key used by the WTForm library.


## Testing

After you have configured pytest as the testing tool for PyCharm (File - Settings - Tools - Python Integrated Tools - Testing), you can then run tests from within PyCharm by right clicking the tests folder and selecting "Run pytest in tests".

Alternatively, from a terminal in the root folder of the project, you can also call 'python -m pytest tests' to run all the tests. PyCharm also provides a built-in terminal, which uses the configured virtual environment.
